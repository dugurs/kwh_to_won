# schema has a single required host field, but it could include a number of fields
# such as username, password etc. See other components in the HA core code for
# further examples.
# Note the input displayed to the user will be translated. See the
# translations/<lang>.json file and strings.json. See here for further information:
# https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/config_entries_config_flow_handler/#translations
# At the time of writing I found the translations created by the scaffold didn't
# quite work as documented and always gave me the "Lokalise key references" string
# (in square brackets), rather than the actual translated value. I did not attempt to
# figure this out or look further into it.
